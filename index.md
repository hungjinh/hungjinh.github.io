Hi, I'm Hung-Jin Huang. I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [University of Arizona, Steward Observatory](https://www.as.arizona.edu). I study the growth of structure to understand both cosmology and galaxy formation physics. My main research focuses on weak lensing science. More specifically, I measure and study astrophysical systematics on weak lensing observables. The two main astrophysical systematics I've explored are intrinsic alignment of galaxies the effects of baryons on matter distribution.
