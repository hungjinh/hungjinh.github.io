Hi, I'm Hung-Jin Huang, a PhD student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/). I study the growth of structure in our Universe to understand both cosmology and galaxy formation physics. I work with Prof. [Rachel Mandelbaum](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/rmandelb/) on projects related to weak lensing science, investigating the origin of uncertainties and systematics on weak lensing observables. More specifically, I studied intrinsic alignment of galaxies in galaxy clusters. I have been exploring mitigaton techniques for baryonic uncertainties, with the goal to better constrain cosmology by incorporating small-scale information in data analysis. Currently, I'm working on extracting the baryonic feature of our Universe from [Dark Energy Survey](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org) data, and comparing it with various cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.


I received my bachelor's degree in physics from [National Taiwan University](http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). After that, I worked at [ASIAA](https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) with Prof. [Chin-Fei Lee](https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/people/cv.php?i=cflee) on radiative transfer modeling of protobinary stars, and Prof. [Yen-Ting Lin](http://idv.sinica.edu.tw/yentinglin/) on radio galaxies to complete my master degree in astrophysics.

I was born in Taichung, Taiwan. My name is written as 黃虹瑾 in Traditional Chinese. I like mountains, forests, caves, and skiing.
